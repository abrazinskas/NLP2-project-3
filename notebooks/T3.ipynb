    "Similary to T2, the model outperforms the baseline based on accuracy. However, it producs very high AER, and converges to a state where a majority of French words are aligned to null tokens. This problem can be explained by a small vocabulary or by the fact that more complex models are not necessarily are better at capturing latent assignments. "
